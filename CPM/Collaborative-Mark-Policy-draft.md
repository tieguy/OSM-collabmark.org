# DRAFT
# Open Street Map Trademark Policy
# DRAFT

TODOs:
- [ ] replace "Community" with OSM"
- [ ] Copy community mission language from existing policy
- [ ] Discuss applicability (nth try at this).
- [ ] Pick one of "you may" or "you can".
- [ ] Make clear that mere attribution (as required by the license) is typically nominative use, and does not require a license, unless it somehow implies endorsement?

Open questions for OSM legal team:
- [ ] License throughout speaks of OSM projects, plural - does that really make sense?
- [ ] Ask OSM about quick license - does it make sense for OSM?
- [ ] Social media user names not really well-addressed - should they be in Sec. 3 (permitted, no license) or Sec. 4 (needs license)? Old OSM draft policy tends to imply Sec. 3.4, perhaps with a requirement that you clarify non-endorsement?

## Introduction
### Why does OSM have marks?
The Open Street Map marks represent OSM and its work to bring open map data to the entire world. When users see the Open Street Map name and logo, they should be confident that they are looking at a high quality map that is the result of the rigorous and comprehensive collaboration process of Open Street Map. Trademark protection helps reinforces that connection.

### What are the goals of this trademark policy?
The goodwill supporting the OSM marks has been generated by a prolific and passionate volunteer community. The Open Street Map Foundation has prepared this policy to preserve and protect that goodwill by ensuring that uses of the marks are consistent with OSM's mission and promote the OSM movement.

### How is this trademark policy different?
This trademark policy seeks to make trademark licensing as easy as possible for the community that created OSM, by making explicit that many uses do not require a trademark license, and empowering community members to use OSM's marks without a trademark license for community-focused events and outreach work. We hope that this helps spread OSM and encourage contribution while also ensuring that the mark remains a reliable signal of quality.

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1. The “Community marks”
The Community marks (or sometimes just "marks") are both registered and unregistered trademarks of the Community, including non-stylized wordmarks and the trade dress of each Community project. Here is a non-exclusive list of our trademarks: 
- "OpenStreetMap"
- "OSM" when used in the geo data context
- the OpenStreetMap magnifying glass logo
- "OpenStreetMap Foundation"
- "OSM Foundation"
- "OSMF" `[when used in the geodata context?]`
- "State of the Map"
- "SotM" `[when used in the geodata context?]`
- the logos of the State of the Map conference

The purpose of the Community marks, and this policy, is to protect the goodwill created by community members through their work on the collaboratively-developed Community projects.

### 1.2. “We” or the “Trademark steward”
The Trademark steward (sometimes just "we") is the Open Street Map Foundation, which acts as a steward for the Community marks, including acting as the registrant for the Community's registered marks.

### 1.3. “You”
“You” is anyone who wants to use the Community marks. You may be a community member (as further explained in Sec. 1.3.1) or an unrelated individual or organization (as further explained in Sec. 1.3.2).

#### 1.3.1. Community members
In this policy, "Community members" includes everyone who contributes to a community project in furtherance of the Community's mission. It also includes members and staff of recognized OSM organizations, such as the local chapters and the Trademark steward.

As detailed in the rest of the policy, Community members are generally free to use all Community marks on the Community projects and for community-focused events, such as outreach work, without a trademark license. Community members can also generally easily get a license for other permitted uses. 

#### 1.3.2. Unrelated organizations or individuals
In this policy, "You" may include individuals and companies who are not contributors, but who want to use our content and display our well-known marks in movies, books, apps, or other media. 

As long as consumers of those media are not confused about the source of those works, this type of use can promote the Community projects and mission and potentially recruit new contributors to the Community. However, it is important that the Community marks are not misleadingly used to market others’ products, because that will confuse users of our project. Therefore, as detailed in the rest of the policy, such use is never allowed without a trademark license. 

### 1.4. “Mission”
Our mission is to make the best map data set of the world, available under a free and open license to everybody. For more details, see our [mission statement](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Mission_Statement). 

### 1.5. “Community projects”
The Community projects include the Open Street Map and related database, the Open Street Map Foundation, the State of the Map conference, and other related community-supported projects. `[QQQ: Any key activities missing here?]`

## 2. How to use the Community marks

`[QQQ: LV believes OSM has no visual identity guidelines, or equivalent document on use of the mark. Please let me know if otherwise.]` 

This section applies to all uses of the Community marks, regardless of why you are allowed to use the marks. Whenever you use the Community marks, note the following:

### 2.1. Proper form

You may:
* use the wordmarks as a proper name (e.g. “Community is great”) or as an adjective (e.g. “the Community projects are awesome”). This includes any of the official translations and transliterations of the Community marks.
* use Community wordmarks in their full form and properly capitalized (e.g. "`[insert example of community wordmark]`").

You may not:
* abbreviate the wordmarks or combine them with other words (e.g. not "`[insert example of abbreviation like "Wiki"]`").
* modify or remix the logos without permission from the Trademark steward. We need to make sure that the logos remain distinctive from other marks.

### 2.2. Notice or trademark symbol
Please include this notice, or something similar, when you use a mark outside of the Community projects: 

> Wordmark / name of logo is a trademark of the Open Street Map Foundation, and is used with their permission. We are not endorsed by or affiliated with the Open Street Map Foundation.

The notice should appear near the first use of a Community mark. One notice is enough if you display multiple marks, provided the notice refers to all of them.

If the mark will primarily appear on a mobile screen or another medium with limited visual space, you may instead use a trademark symbol (™) with the mark to show that it is a Community trademark. When you use a symbol due to limited space and there are additional pages to your material, please include the notice in the text of a prominent page (for example, the "about us" section of a mobile app).

Regardless of whether you use a notice or a trademark symbol to identify your use of Community marks, make sure that your use does not suggest endorsement by or affiliation with the Trademark steward. 

## 3. When you may use the Community marks without asking us

In many cases, you can use the Community marks without asking for permission from the Community steward. This section lists those cases. Uses that are not allowed under this Section require a trademark license, discussed in more detail in Section 4.

### 3.1. Community-focused events
You may use the trademarks for events that promote our mission and are intended to be predominantly attended by community members, like [mapathons](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapathon). For example, you can put the OSM logo on banners and posters to promote a mapathon you've organized. 

This provision does not allow you to use the marks for fundraising.

### 3.2. Outreach and recruiting new contributors 
You may use the marks consistent with our mission to educate people about the Community projects and to recruit new contributors, as long as you make it clear that you do not work for the Trademark steward. You can create educational material or banners to decorate a public fair stand or to publicize an event. But, please don’t sell any of them. 

This provision does not allow you to use the marks for fundraising. 

### 3.3. Discussing something other than Community projects (fair use)
Wordmarks can sometimes have a primary meaning, in addition to representing a brand (like the words “apple” or “facebook”). We will interpret fair use broadly when you use the marks but really mean to talk about something other than the Community projects.

### 3.4. Refer to Community projects (nominative use)
You can use the non-stylized wordmarks (such as "Open Street Map") to name or refer to:
 - A Community project or another aspect of the movement in a text (for example, "I love seeing my community on Open Street Map").
 - A project derived from a Community project in a way that is not misleading (for example, "This company's maps are based on Open Street Map").

Here are some specific examples of nominative use:

#### 3.4.1. News reporting

You can use the Community marks to make truthful statements about the Community projects in news reports and commentary.

#### 3.4.2. Personal blogs and social media
You can use the Community marks to make truthful statements about the Community projects in personal blogs and social media. But please don’t imply endorsement by, or affiliation with, the Trademark steward. 

To avoid confusion, don’t use the Community logos in the background, as your profile image, or in the header of your blog. You also should not use the marks in the name of your blog or in your social media username.

#### 3.4.3. Artistic, scientific, literary, political, and other non-commercial uses 
You can use the Community marks to discuss the Community projects in artistic, scientific, literary, and political work. 

But please send us a request if you want to place a Community mark on the cover of your book, display a Community mark in a movie, or organize an event or presentation that could appear to be endorsed by the Trademark steward. For more information, please see the portion of this policy on “special uses that require permission” (Section 4).

You may also use the marks in satire or jokes. To avoid confusing users that your work is affiliated with the Community projects, it may be helpful to mark your work as “satire” or “parody.”

#### 3.4.4. Links to Community projects

You may use the marks on your own website as a hyperlink to the Community projects. If you are using the logo, though, do not modify the logo except to resize it.

### 3.5. Make your own branded stuff
You may create things with the marks for your own use. These can be t-shirts, caps, desktop wallpapers, and even cakes! But please don’t sell them. 

If you want to _sell_ your branded stuff, you can request a license under Section 4.6. 

## 4. Special uses that require permission

All uses that are not allowed under Section 3 or prohibited by Section 5 of this policy require a trademark license. This section discusses only the most common uses that require a license.

To contact the Community steward to get a license for one of these uses, email legal@osmfoundation.org with subject "Trademark Use Request" and the information requested below in the relevant section.

When you use our marks under a trademark license, you need to comply with its terms as well as with this trademark policy. If some term in your license is inconsistent with this policy, you should follow the license terms. Related organizations will only need a separate license when the use is not already authorized by their organizational agreements with the Trademark steward or this policy.

### 4.1. Domain names
You need a trademark license to register or use a domain name that contains a Community mark in it. Please don’t register a domain that looks or sounds similar to a Community mark, or includes a misspelled Community mark, as that can confuse Community users.

### 4.2. Events and conferences
You need a trademark license if you plan to host a public event or a conference that uses a Community mark. 

You should include the following information when requesting a license to use our marks in an event:                                                                                                  
1. What is the proposed title of the event?
2. Who is hosting, sponsoring, or coordinating the event? 
3. Include contact information (and Community username if relevant) for the person organizing the event.
4. Is the event organized for community members?
5. What is the topic of the event?
6. The location, date, and duration of the event.
7. Include handouts, examples, mockups, or other descriptions of the proposed use.

When you get a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific event in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if you want to host another event. 

### 4.3. Publications
You need a trademark license if you want to use a Community mark in a publication in a way that is not fair or nominative use under U.S. trademark law or other applicable foreign laws, such as a book cover that might imply endorsement of your book by the Community steward.

You should include the following information when requesting a license to use our marks in a publication.                                                                                                  
 1. What is the proposed title of the publication?
 2. Contact information (and Community username if relevant) for the applicant.
 3. Who is the author, editor, and publisher of the publication?
 4. For fiction, what is the storyline?
 5. How do you want to use and discuss the mark?
 6. Include printouts of the pages in your publication that includes or discusses the mark. (For a book, where in the book will the mark appear?)
 7. If your publication will display a screenshot of a Community project, please include that as well. 
 8. Will the publication be in hard copy, an e-book, or some other type of medium? 
 9. What is the print run and distribution area for the publication? How many editions will it have?

When you get a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific publication in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if you want to make another publication. 

### 4.4. Commercial merchandise 
You need a trademark license if you want to make merchandise with the community marks for commercial use. All such licenses will require, at least, that you:
* use our logos without modifying them; and
* truthfully advertise to customers how much of the selling price, if any, will be donated to Community projects.

## 5. Prohibited uses

Some uses of the marks are never permitted. This section discusses the most common examples of such prohibited uses.

### 5.1. Misleading mirrors and mimicking sites
Please don’t create a website that mimics the 'look and feel' of a Community project. If you have a good reason to create a site that uses our look and feel, please contact the Trademark steward at legal@osmfoundation.org. However, you don’t need to contact us if your mimicking site is clearly a parody. 

If you create a mirror, make sure to comply with the relevant licenses for the content. Avoid copying links to legal policies and contact details that are unique for the Community projects. Please don’t use the Community marks in a mirror of a Community site.

### 5.2. Linking to non-Trademark steward sites
You may use Community marks to link to Community projects only. Please refer to Section 3.4.4 if you want to link to a Community project from your website.

### 5.3. Misrepresentation
When you use a Community mark, do not create the impression that your use is in any way endorsed, or sponsored by, or part of the Trademark steward. This section also applies when you are granted a license to use a mark that doesn’t permit you to suggest such an endorsement.

## 6. Trademark abuse

### 6.1. Reporting abuse
Fighting trademark abuse is very important. We put a lot of effort into going after cases of trademark infringement because we want to protect the valuable trademark rights the community has created. If you see a mark being used in any way that could be infringing, please tell us! Just send an email to the Trademark steward at legal@osmfoundation.org. We really appreciate your help!

### 6.2. Revoking permission for abusive uses 
We may revoke the right to use the Community marks under this policy at any time by providing notice in any manner if we determine that a trademark use is inconsistent with our mission, or could harm community members, our project, or the Trademark steward.

## 7. Revision of the trademark policy

This trademark policy can be revised under the following circumstances:
* For significant changes, we will give at least 30 days notice, and opportunity to comment, on the Community projects and in an email to `[relevant community mailing list]`.
* For minor changes or changes required by law, when possible we will provide three days’ notice to `[relevant community mailing list]`.  Minor changes include language fixes, administrative changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements.
* For changes to the user-friendly summary, the purpose statement, the FAQs, the trademark request form, and the violation reporting form, we can make changes without notice.

### 7.2. `[If relevant: Translation of the trademark policy`
`If some term in a translation of this trademark policy is inconsistent with the original English version of this policy, you should follow the original English version.]`

## 8. Questions
Please don't hesitate to contact us at `[email address]` if you are not sure whether your use is in compliance with this policy or local trademark laws.
