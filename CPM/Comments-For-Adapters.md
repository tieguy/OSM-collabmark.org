This file contains notes that should be considered by anyone seeking to adapt the CollabMark template for use by other open or collaborative projects.
# General
## If you are _not_ a lawyer (SUPER IMPORTANT)
The CollabMark template was drafted by lawyers, and based on work done by lawyers in collaboration with the Wikimedia community. If you're considering adapting it for your community, _please consult an attorney_. Trademarks are easy to lose, and hard to get back once lost.
## If you _are_ a lawyer
If you are a lawyer, to understand the philosophy behind this policy in more detail, it may be helpful to read [Hacking Trademark Law for Collaborative Communities](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2476779), published in the _Fordham Intellectual Property, Media & Entertainment Law Journal_.

# Introduction
* _Community_: For readability, it is probably best to search and replace this everywhere with a one-word term or acronym for your community.
* _"they"/"we" in paragraph about goodwill_: This paragraph (and other places in the document) refer to "they" and "we" without much context. "we" typically refers to the incorporated entity that has actually registered the mark on behalf of the community of contributors; "they" to the contributors/community. This is covered below in the definitions (Sec. 1.3).
* _"Our mission relies on and encourages free speech"_: The first two sentences of this paragraph are holdovers from the Wikimedia project, which holds free speech as a central value. It may be less applicable to your project. However, assuming that your project is truly a collaborative one (and this policy probably doesn't make sense if not), then the 3rd and 4th sentences are likely extremely applicable and should be retained.

# Section 1
* *Presentation*: The original [WMF presentation of this policy](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Trademark_policy) can be helpful to refer to when reading through this policy; in particular, it shows how section headers are visually presented, which may be helpful when deciding whether to incorporate text from the headers into the body of the policy.

# Section 2
* Section 2.2 uses ™ rather than ® because some jurisdictions penalize use of ® when the mark is not registered. If that does not apply to your project (say, because your mark is registered in all relevant jurisdictions) then change this to refer to ®.

# Section 3
* Section 3.3 may or may not be relevant to your project, depending on whether your mark is fanciful, descriptive, etc. Review and revise appropriately.
