# OSM Trademark FAQ

## What can I do with domains or company names containing "OpenStreetMap" that I registered before Jan. 1st, 2013?
Domain and company names registered in good faith before January 1st, 2013, will be licensed to the original registrant on request. The new license will require that the domain be transferred to the OSMF or de-registered if any of the following events occur:
* no longer in use for OpenStreetMap related services, products or similar;
* change of control events (sale, mergers etc);
* bankruptcy, dissolution, or similar corporate events; or
* death of an individual non-corporate licensee
Alternately, on a case-by-case basis, the OSMF may determine that it is necessary to avoid such issues by having such names transferred to the OSMF and to licencing them back to the registrant. In such a case the OSMF will carry all costs of the transfer.
